<h1>Black Social Users</h1>
	   </div>
	   
<p>Black activists influence social change using Twitter and other social media platforms. There are many social issues impacting the Black community -- including racial profiling, police brutality, the endangerment of black lives, taboo social issues and how the Black Lives Matter Movement can be inclusive of all black lives. There's little data on how black social media users influence activism. Although, Black people are using social media usage across platforms at a greater rate than any other group.</p>

<h2>Black Social Users Still Dominate Twitter in 2014</h2>

<p>Black folks are still on Twitter more than any other ethnic group, but Hispanics are close behind. Twenty-seven percent of Black Internet users are on Twitter while Hispanics are on the platform at 25 percent. White people use the platform not nearly behind Black and Hispanic people, 21 percent of White Internet users use the platform as well.</p>

<h2>Black Teens Are a Top Demographic of Twitter Usage</h2>

<p>Black social users dominate the most within its teenage demographic. Just a few years ago, Black teenagers used Twitter at 39 percent of all Internet teenage usage. White teenager were further behind at 23 percent, but Hispanic teenagers use Twitter at the lowest rate of any other ethnic group surveyed in 2012.</p>

<h2>Black Social Users Can't Win Them All</h2>

<p>Nevertheless, Black social users aren’t winning at every social media platform. Only 4 percent of all Black Internet users used Reddit for community forums in 2013. Hispanics, on the other hand, led in usage of this social media platform at 11 percent.</p>

<h2>Ethnicity and Gender Play Significant Role in Twitter Usage of Demographics</h2>

<p>Age isn't the only specific dynamic of Black social media usage nor is Twitter the only platform Black folks use -- unlike Reddit. Black males and Black females used Twitter and other social media platforms at steadily even rate in 2013. White males and White females social media usage is more varied. White males used Twitter more than White females, but the latter used other social media platforms more than former.</p>

<p>Black and White demographics used social media networks -- like Facebook, LinkedIn and Google Plus -- at a closer percentage. Although White social users use these social platforms at 1 percent lesser than Black social users, who are at 73 percent.</p>

<h2>Black People Dominate at Using Twitter, Not the Company's Employment</h2>

<p>Nevertheless, currently Black people aren’t getting that many employment opportunities at Twitter, although they use the social media platform the most. Their White counterparts dominate in Twitter employment across tech, non-tech and leadership. But it’s not just very little Black employees. Other people of color are employed less than White counterparts while Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander and American Indian/Native Alaskan are completely non-existent in certain areas of employment at Twitter.</p>
